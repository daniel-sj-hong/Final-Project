# Choice.ly

A web application for people that need help deciding where to eat.

I built this application because I often find myself in a group of friends and we are all very indecisive on where to eat. This application lets you view certain restaurants that you might be interested in, favorite them onto a favorites list, and then have a randomizer select a random restaurant among your favorited restaurants for you.
